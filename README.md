# Technical Documentation Page

## Overview

This project is a **Technical Documentation Page** designed to showcase different programming concepts and technologies with sections for **HTML & CSS**, **JavaScript**, **DOM Manipulation**, **APIs**, and **Web Design**. The page provides a functional navigation system, a fixed sidebar, and a responsive layout.

## Features

- **Navigation**: A fixed sidebar (navbar) that links to each section of the documentation. Clicking a link scrolls smoothly to the relevant section.
- **Responsiveness**: The page is fully responsive and adjusts the layout for both small (mobile) and large (desktop) screens.
- **Sections**: The page is divided into five sections, each covering different programming topics with explanations, code examples, and lists.

## User Stories Fulfilled

1. The page includes a main element with the id `main-doc`.
2. There are five sections with a class `main-section`.
3. Each section contains at least 10 paragraphs and five code examples.
4. Each section has an id that corresponds to the section header text (spaces replaced with underscores).
5. The navigation bar (`#navbar`) is fixed on the left side and contains links to each section.
6. The page is responsive and adapts to smaller screens using a media query.
